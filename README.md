# Youtube Auto Sub
- This is a CLI tool which uses the YouTube API to automatically subscribe a user to a list of youtube channels.
- It ingests youtube channels as a JSON list and subscribes the authenticated user to those channels

# Why?
- I wanted an automated way to subscribe to many youtube channels, given a list of channel urls
- I wanted to increase my exposure and experience with the Rust programming language.
